# Search Console Removal

One time, I need to remove old sites from Google Search Console. It's for my old outdated website, and I want people to find my [actual website](https://rab.al) instead of the old one.

## Register to Search Console

Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and register your website.

You can also add a domain instead of a single URL.

## Verify Ownership

You're going to need to add some HTML to the deployment or use other methods like adding a TXT record to your DNS.

## Request Removal

After you verify your ownership, you can request removal.
