# Take Commits Between Repositories

## Source

Copy the commit hash

![Source Image Hash](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/CleanShot_2023-02-28_at_22.19.472x.png)

For example, I want to take this commit: `eccde65`

## Replica

> I’ll use term **replica** for other repositories that might use the same starter/components.

1. Add the **source** remote to the **replica** repository

   ```bash
   git remote add source https://github.com/theodorusclarence/aether-design-system.git
   #              ^you can name it whatever you like
   ```

2. Fetch remote

   ```bash
   git fetch source
   #         ^or your remote name

   git fetch --all
   # ^if you're feeling lazy (fetch all available repo)
   ```

3. Cherry pick

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick eccde65
   ```

   If you have multiple commits to pick from, for example these 3:

   ![multiple commit images](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled.png)

   put the oldest commit first, the order matters

   ex: `git cherry-pick 8cfc164 dee8c34 eccde65`

4. Done

   ![cherry pick applied](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled%201.png)

   it works even if you have other commits that are different from the **source**

## Common Case: Conflict

It’s quite common, don’t panic

For example, you have a commit in the **replica** that changed PaginatedTable

![replica changes](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled%202.png)

And you also have a different change on the **source’s** commit `eccde65`

![source's commit](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled%203.png)

It will create a conflict like this

![conflict in terminal](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled%204.png)

![conflict in vscode](/images/uncategorized/cherry-pick-between-repo/Untitled%205.png)

Solve them, add to staging, then continue the cherrypick

```bash
git cherry-pick --continue
```
