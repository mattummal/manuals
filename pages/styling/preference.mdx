# Styling Preference

For now, Tailwind CSS is my go-to styling library to use. It is a great tool for styling websites.

Although Tailwind CSS is a great tool, I also love the original CSSâ€”preferably SCSS.

Here are some styling solutions that I prefer:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
