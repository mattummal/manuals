# Margin Usage

When using margins, try to only make an effect on the element that you put the margin to. It will be so much easier to maintain.

## The Ways

Practically, there are 3 ways that you can use to add some spacing to your elements.

## Top and Bottom

It's not a good practice, because the margin will collapse.

It's something that you don't want to have in your CSS. It will cause unexpected behavior.

## Top or Bottom

Nice, both work. But, why prefer one over the other?

## Margin Bottom Side Effect

When using **margin-bottom,** this problem will appear

When you remove an element, a side effect requires you to adjust the top element margins.

It is a nightmare to maintain because you need to find that other element, even though we change the other.

## Eliminating Side Effects

Instead, just use **margin-top**

It just works.
