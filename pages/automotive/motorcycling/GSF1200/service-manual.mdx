## **GENERAL PRECAUTIONS**

### **⚠️ WARNING**
- Proper service and repair procedures are important for the safety of the service mechanic and the safety and reliability of the motorcycle.
- When 2 or more persons work together, pay attention to the safety of each other.
- When it is necessary to run the engine indoors, make sure that exhaust gas is forced outdoors.
- When working with toxic or flammable materials, make sure that the area you work in is well-ventilated and that you follow all of the material manufacturer’s instructions.
- Never use gasoline as a cleaning solvent.
- To avoid getting burned, do not touch the engine, engine oil, oil cooler, and exhaust system until they have cooled.
- After servicing the fuel, oil, exhaust, or brake systems, check all lines and fittings related to the system for leaks.

### **⚠️ CAUTION**
- If parts replacement is necessary, replace the parts with Suzuki Genuine Parts or their equivalents.
- When removing parts that are to be reused, keep them arranged in an orderly manner so they may be reinstalled in the proper order and orientation.
- Be sure to use special tools when instructed.
- Make sure that all parts used in reassembly are clean. Lubricate them when specified.
- Use the specified lubricant, bond, or sealant.
- When removing the battery, disconnect the negative cable first and then the positive cable. When reconnecting the battery, connect the positive cable first and then the negative cable, and replace the terminal cover on the positive terminal.
- When performing service to electrical parts, if the service procedures do not require use of battery power, disconnect the negative cable of the battery.
- Tighten the cylinder head and case bolts and nuts in the specified tightening order and torque.
- Reuse a circlip only when installing a new circlip, ensuring it is seated securely in its groove.
