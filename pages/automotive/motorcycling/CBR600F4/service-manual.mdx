## General Maintenance
## General Safety

### Carbon Monoxide

If the engine must be running to do some work, make sure the area is well ventilated. Never run the engine in an enclosed area.

> **Warning**: The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that can cause loss of consciousness and may lead to death.

### Used Engine Oil

> **Warning**: Used engine oil may cause skin cancer if repeatedly left in contact with the skin for prolonged periods. Although this is unlikely unless you handle used oil on a daily basis, it is still advisable to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water as soon as possible after handling used oil.

### Gasoline

Work in a well-ventilated area. Keep cigarettes, flames, or sparks away from the work area or where gasoline is stored.

> **Warning**: Gasoline is extremely flammable and is explosive under certain conditions. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

### Brake Dust

> **Warning**: Never use an air hose or dry brush to clean the brake assemblies. Use a vacuum cleaner or alternate method to minimize the hazard caused by airborne asbestos fibers.

### Hot Components

> **Warning**: Engine and exhaust system parts become very hot and remain hot for some time after the engine is run. Wear insulated gloves or wait until the engine and exhaust system have cooled before handling these parts.


### Coolant

Under some conditions, the ethylene glycol in engine coolant is combustible and its flame is not visible. If the ethylene glycol does ignite, you will not see any flame, but you can be burned.

> **Warning**
> - Avoid spilling engine coolant on the exhaust system or engine parts. They may be hot enough to cause the coolant to ignite and burn without a visible flame.
> - Coolant (ethylene glycol) can cause some skin irritation and is poisonous if swallowed. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.
> - Do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot. The coolant is under pressure and could scald you.
> - Keep hands and clothing away from the cooling fan, as it starts automatically.

> **Caution**
> Using coolant with silicate corrosion inhibitors may cause premature wear of water pump seals or blockage of radiator passages. Using tap water may cause engine damage.

### Battery Hydrogen Gas & Electrolyte

> **Warning**
> - The battery gives off explosive gases; keep sparks, flames and cigarettes away. Provide adequate ventilation when charging.
> - The battery contains sulfuric acid (electrolyte). Contact with skin or eyes may cause severe burns. Wear protective clothing and a face shield.
>   - If electrolyte gets on your skin, flush with water.
>   - If electrolyte gets in your eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician immediately.
> - Electrolyte is poisonous.
>   - If swallowed, drink large quantities of water or milk and follow with milk of magnesia or vegetable oil and call a physician. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

### Service Rules

1. Use genuine HONDA or HONDA-recommended parts and lubricants or their equivalents. Parts that don’t meet HONDA’s design specifications may cause damage to the motorcycle.

### Emission Control Systems

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Transport Canada, and California Air Resources Board (CARB) require manufacturers to certify that their motorcycles comply with applicable exhaust emissions standards during their useful life, when operated and maintained according to the instructions provided, and that motorcycles built after January 1, 1983 comply with applicable noise emission standards for one year or 6,000 km (3,730 miles) after the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser, when operated and maintained according to the instructions provided. Compliance with the terms of the Distributor's Limited Warranty for Honda Motorcycle Emission Control Systems is necessary in order to keep the emissions system warranty in effect.

#### Source of Emissions

The combustion process produces carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Controlling hydrocarbon emissions is very important because, under certain conditions, they react to form photochemical smog when subjected to sunlight. Carbon monoxide does not react in the same way, but it is toxic.

Honda Motor Co., Ltd. utilizes lean carburetor settings as well as other systems, to reduce carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.

#### Crankcase Emission Control System

The engine is equipped with a closed crankcase system to prevent discharging crankcase emissions into the atmosphere. Blow-by gas is returned to the combustion chamber through the air cleaner and carburetor.

<!-- ![Crankcase Emission Control System](path/to/crankcase-emission-control-system-image.png) -->

#### Exhaust Emission Control System (Pulse Secondary Air Injection System)

The exhaust emission control system consists of a secondary air supply system which introduces filtered air into the exhaust gases in the exhaust port. Fresh air is drawn into the exhaust port whenever there is a negative pressure pulse in the exhaust system. This charge of fresh air promotes burning of the unburned exhaust gases and changes a considerable amount of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into relatively harmless carbon dioxide and water vapor.

This model has the pulse secondary air injection (PAIR) control valve and PAIR check valves. PAIR check valve prevents reverse air flow through the system. The PAIR control valve reacts to high intake manifold vacuum and will cut off the supply of fresh air during engine deceleration, thereby preventing afterburn in the exhaust system.

No adjustment to the pulse secondary air injection system should be made, although periodic inspection of the components is recommended.

<!-- ![Exhaust Emission Control System](path/to/exhaust-emission-control-system-image.png) -->

#### Evaporative Emission Control System (California type only)

This model complies with California Air Resources Board evaporative emission requirements.

Fuel vapor from the fuel tank and carburetors is routed into the evaporative emission (EVAP) canister where it is adsorbed and stored while the engine is stopped. When the engine is running and the EVAP purge control valve is open, fuel vapor in the EVAP canister is drawn into the engine through the carburetor. At the same time, the EVAP carburetor air vent (CAV) solenoid valve is open and air is drawn into the carburetor through the valve.

#### Noise Emission Control System

Tampering with the noise control system is prohibited. Federal law prohibits the following acts or the causing thereof: 
1. Removal of or puncturing of the muffler, baffles, header pipes or any other component which conducts exhaust gases.
2. Removal of, or puncturing of any part of the intake system.
3. Lack of proper maintenance.
4. Replacing any moving parts of the vehicle, or parts of the exhaust or intake system, with parts other than those specified by the manufacturer.

### Emission Control Information Labels

An Emission Control Information Label is located on the rear fender under the seat as shown. It gives basic tune-up specifications.

#### Vehicle Emission Control Information Update Label

After making a high altitude carburetor adjustment (page 5-34), attach an update label on the rear fender under the seat as shown.

Instructions for obtaining the update label are given in Service Letter No. 132.

When readjusting the carburetors back to the low altitude specifications, be sure to remove this update label.

#### Vacuum Hose Routing Diagram Label (California type only)

<!-- ![Emission Control Information Labels](path/to/emission-control-information-labels-image.png) -->

The Vacuum Hose Routing Diagram Label is located on the air cleaner housing cover as shown. The fuel tank must be removed to read it.

### Service Information

#### General

> **Warning**
> - Gasoline is extremely flammable and is explosive under certain conditions. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.
