## General Maintenance
## General Safety

### Carbon Monoxide

If the engine must be running to do some work, make sure the area is well ventilated. Never run the engine in an enclosed area.

> **Warning**: The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that can cause loss of consciousness and may lead to death.

### Used Engine Oil

> **Warning**: Used engine oil may cause skin cancer if repeatedly left in contact with the skin for prolonged periods. Although this is unlikely unless you handle used oil on a daily basis, it is still advisable to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water as soon as possible after handling used oil.

### Gasoline

Work in a well-ventilated area. Keep cigarettes, flames, or sparks away from the work area or where gasoline is stored.

> **Warning**: Gasoline is extremely flammable and is explosive under certain conditions. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

### Brake Dust

> **Warning**: Never use an air hose or dry brush to clean the brake assemblies. Use a vacuum cleaner or alternate method to minimize the hazard caused by airborne asbestos fibers.

### Hot Components

> **Warning**: Engine and exhaust system parts become very hot and remain hot for some time after the engine is run. Wear insulated gloves or wait until the engine and exhaust system have cooled before handling these parts.

### Coolant

> **Warning**: Avoid spilling engine coolant on the exhaust system or engine parts. They may be hot enough to cause the coolant to ignite and burn without a visible flame.

### Battery Hydrogen Gas & Electrolyte

> **Warning**: The battery gives off explosive gases; keep sparks, flames, and cigarettes away. Provide adequate ventilation when charging.
