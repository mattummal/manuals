## Engine

### Oil and Filter Change

1. **Preparation:**
   - Start the engine and run for a few minutes to warm the oil (this will make it drain faster).
   - Place the bike on a level surface and use a center stand if available.
   - Use a pan to collect the old oil.

2. **Procedure:**
   - Remove the drain plug from the engine oil pan.
   - Allow the oil to drain completely.
   - Replace the drain plug and install a new oil filter.
   - Fill with recommended oil (10W-40 or equivalent, 2.9 liters).

3. **Check Oil Level:**
   - Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes, then turn it off.
   - Let the oil settle and check the oil level using the dipstick.

---

### Air Filter

1. **Removal:**
   - Locate the air filter housing under the fuel tank.
   - Remove the screws securing the air filter cover and carefully take out the filter.

2. **Cleaning/Replacement:**
   - If the filter is reusable, clean it with compressed air (from the inside out) or wash it with mild detergent.
   - If the filter is too damaged or excessively dirty, replace it with a new one.

---

## Transmission

1. **Chain Adjustment:**
   - Check the slack on the chain. It should have about 25-35mm of play.
   - Adjust the chain tension by loosening the rear axle nut and using the adjusters on either side of the swingarm.

2. **Lubrication:**
   - Clean the chain using a degreaser and brush.
   - Apply chain lube to the entire chain, focusing on the inner side.

---

## Brakes

### Brake Fluid Change

1. **Preparation:**
   - Place the bike securely on a stand.
   - Remove the brake fluid reservoir cap.

2. **Procedure:**
   - Use a brake fluid syringe to remove old fluid from the reservoir.
   - Refill with the recommended brake fluid (DOT 4).
   - Bleed the brakes by using a brake bleeder kit to remove air from the brake lines.

3. **Check Brake Pads:**
   - Inspect brake pads for wear. Replace if the thickness is below 1mm.

---

## Suspension

1. **Forks:**
   - Check for any oil leakage from the forks.
   - If needed, replace the fork oil with the specified type and amount.

2. **Rear Shock Absorber:**
   - Ensure the rear shock is not leaking fluid.
   - Adjust preload, damping, and rebound as necessary based on riding preferences.

---

## Electrical System

### Battery

1. **Checking Voltage:**
   - Use a multimeter to check the battery voltage (should be around 12.6V when the bike is off).
   - If the voltage is low, recharge the battery or replace it if itâ€™s no longer holding a charge.

2. **Maintenance:**
   - Ensure the terminals are clean and free of corrosion. Use a wire brush if necessary.

---

### Fuses

1. **Inspection:**
   - Locate the fuse box, typically near the battery or under the seat.
   - Check for any blown fuses and replace with the appropriate rating.

---

## Tires and Wheels

1. **Tire Pressure:**
   - Front: 2.25 bar (32 psi)
   - Rear: 2.50 bar (36 psi)

2. **Tire Inspection:**
   - Check for uneven wear, punctures, or damage to the tires.
   - Replace tires if tread depth is below 1.5mm.

---

## Final Drive

1. **Inspection:**
   - Check the condition of the rear sprocket and chain for any signs of wear.
   - Lubricate the chain regularly and ensure proper tension.

2. **Sprocket Teeth:**
   - Inspect the sprocket teeth for signs of wear or damage. Replace if necessary.

---

## Fuel System

1. **Fuel Filter Replacement:**
   - Remove the fuel tank.
   - Disconnect the fuel lines and remove the old fuel filter.
   - Replace with a new fuel filter and reconnect the lines.

---

## Cleaning and Storage

1. **Cleaning:**
   - Wash the bike regularly using mild soap and water.
   - Clean the chain and lubricate it after every wash.

2. **Storage:**
   - If storing for a long period, fill the fuel tank to prevent rusting, and add a fuel stabilizer.
   - Remove the battery and store it in a cool, dry place.
