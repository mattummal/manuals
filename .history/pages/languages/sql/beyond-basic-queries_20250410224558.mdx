# Advanced SQL: Beyond Basic Queries

```sql
-- Example: Recursive CTE for hierarchical data
WITH RECURSIVE org_tree AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE id = 1  -- CEO

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_tree ot ON e.manager_id = ot.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_tree;
```

## Window Functions: Powerful Data Analysis

### Common Window Functions
| Function          | Description                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()`    | Unique sequential row numbers       |
| `RANK()`          | Rank with gaps for ties             |
| `DENSE_RANK()`    | Rank without gaps                   |
| `LEAD()/LAG()`    | Access next/previous row values     |
| `FIRST_VALUE()`   | First value in window frame         |
| `SUM() OVER()`    | Running/cumulative sums             |

```sql
-- Running total example
SELECT
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Types of CTEs
1. **Basic CTE**
   ```sql
   WITH regional_sales AS (
       SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY region
   )
   SELECT * FROM regional_sales;
   ```

2. **Recursive CTE** (for hierarchical data)
   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
       -- Base case
       SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
       FROM employees
       WHERE manager_id IS NULL

       UNION ALL

       -- Recursive case
       SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
       FROM employees e
       JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
   )
   SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
   ```

3. **Materialized CTE** (PostgreSQL)
   ```sql
   WITH MATERIALIZED expensive_query AS (
       SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE complex_condition
   )
   SELECT * FROM expensive_query JOIN other_table...;
   ```

## Indexing Strategies

### When to Index
- Columns frequently in `WHERE` clauses
- Join conditions
- Columns used in `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY`

### Index Types
| Type               | Best For                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| B-Tree             | Default, range queries           |
| Hash               | Exact matches (PostgreSQL)       |
| GiST               | Geometric data, full-text search |
| GIN                | Array/JSON operations            |
| BRIN               | Very large tables with sorting   |

```sql
-- Create a partial index
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email)
WHERE active = true;

-- Multi-column index
CREATE INDEX idx_name_department ON employees(last_name, department_id);
```

## Query Optimization Techniques

### Execution Plan Analysis
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

### Optimization Tips
1. **Avoid SELECT**
   ```sql
   -- Instead of:
   SELECT * FROM customers;

   -- Use:
   SELECT id, name, email FROM customers;
   ```

2. **Use JOINs properly**
   ```sql
   -- Prefer:
   SELECT c.name, o.amount
   FROM customers c
   JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

   -- Over:
   SELECT c.name, o.amount
   FROM customers c, orders o
   WHERE c.id = o.customer_id;
   ```

3. **Limit early**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM large_table
   WHERE condition
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Batch operations**
   ```sql
   -- Instead of multiple INSERTs:
   INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES
   ('Alice'), ('Bob'), ('Charlie');
   ```

## Advanced Joins

### Lateral Joins
```sql
-- Get top 3 products for each category
SELECT c.name, p.product_name, p.price
FROM categories c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT product_name, price
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = c.id
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 3
) p;
```

### Self Joins
```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

## Transaction Isolation Levels

| Level              | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| READ UNCOMMITTED   | Possible    | Possible             | Possible      |
| READ COMMITTED     | No          | Possible             | Possible      |
| REPEATABLE READ    | No          | No                   | Possible      |
| SERIALIZABLE       | No          | No                   | No            |

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN;
-- Critical operations
COMMIT;
```

## JSON Support in Modern SQL

### PostgreSQL JSON Operations
```sql
-- Extract value
SELECT data->>'name' FROM users;

-- Query inside JSON
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE metadata->>'color' = 'blue';

-- JSON aggregation
SELECT
    department_id,
    jsonb_agg(jsonb_build_object('id', id, 'name', name)) AS employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

## Temporal Tables (SQL:2011)

```sql
-- System-versioned temporal table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    valid_from TIMESTAMP(6) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    valid_to TIMESTAMP(6) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (valid_from, valid_to)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;

-- Query historical data
SELECT * FROM products
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01';
```
