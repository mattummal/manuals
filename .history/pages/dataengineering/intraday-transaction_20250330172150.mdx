# Advanced Data Engineering with Python, Azure, PostgreSQL, and DuckDB in Fintech

## Introduction
Data engineering in fintech requires **low-latency analytics**, **real-time fraud detection**, and **cost-efficient data processing**. This guide explores a niche concept: **Intraday Transaction Analysis using DuckDB with PostgreSQL on Azure**.

## Intraday Transaction Analysis in Fintech
Intraday analysis involves **processing millions of transactions** in real-time to detect anomalies, predict risks, and improve financial decision-making. Traditional databases struggle with high-volume aggregations, making **DuckDB a powerful in-memory OLAP engine** for fintech analytics.

## Why Use DuckDB for Fintech Analytics?
- **High-Speed In-Memory Queries**: Faster than PostgreSQL for analytical workloads.
- **Embedded OLAP Processing**: No need for a separate data warehouse.
- **Efficient Handling of Parquet and CSV Files**: Ideal for streaming transaction data.

## Setting Up PostgreSQL and DuckDB for Intraday Analysis

### Step 1: Storing Transactions in Azure PostgreSQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    status VARCHAR(20)
);
```
### Step 2: Streaming PostgreSQL Data into DuckDB
Using **Python and DuckDB**, we can efficiently process real-time data.
```python
import duckdb
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

def load_transactions():
    conn_pg = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname='your_db', user='your_user', password='your_pass', host='your_azure_host', port='5432'
    )
    df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 HOUR'", conn_pg)
    conn_pg.close()

    conn_duck = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
    conn_duck.register('transactions', df)
    return conn_duck
```
### Step 3: Real-Time Fraud Detection Using DuckDB
Using **DuckDBâ€™s fast SQL engine**, we detect fraud patterns:
```python
conn = load_transactions()
fraudulent_txns = conn.execute('''
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS txn_count, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM transactions
    WHERE status = 'approved'
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 50 AND SUM(amount) > 10000
''').fetchdf()
print(fraudulent_txns)
```
### Step 4: Storing Anomalies in Azure Data Lake
Once anomalies are detected, we store them in **Azure Data Lake for further analysis**:
```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
import json

def store_anomalies(anomalies_df):
    blob_service = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_adls_conn_string")
    blob_client = blob_service.get_blob_client(container="fraud-detection", blob="anomalies.json")
    blob_client.upload_blob(anomalies_df.to_json(orient='records'), overwrite=True)
```
### Step 5: Automating with Azure Functions
- Deploy the fraud detection **DuckDB pipeline** as an **Azure Function**.
- Trigger functions on new transactions using **Azure Event Hub**.
- Use **Power BI or Streamlit** for visualization.

## Notable Libraries for Data Engineering in Fintech
As a data engineer working with **Python, Azure, PostgreSQL, and DuckDB**, these libraries are essential:

### 1. **pandas**
   - Used for data manipulation and transformation.
   - Efficiently loads PostgreSQL and DuckDB query results into DataFrames.

### 2. **duckdb**
   - In-memory OLAP database for analytical queries.
   - Optimized for handling large datasets efficiently within Python.

### 3. **psycopg2**
   - The standard PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
   - Used for executing SQL queries and managing database transactions.

### 4. **sqlalchemy**
   - Provides an ORM and database connection management.
   - Supports PostgreSQL and integrates with Azure SQL services.

### 5. **azure-storage-blob**
   - Enables interaction with Azure Blob Storage.
   - Used to store large datasets, logs, and backups.

### 6. **pyarrow**
   - Optimized for working with Parquet and Arrow formats.
   - Enhances DuckDBâ€™s ability to process structured data efficiently.

### 7. **dask**
   - Scalable parallel computing framework.
   - Ideal for handling large-scale ETL operations.

### 8. **dbt (Data Build Tool)**
   - Used for analytics engineering and transforming data in PostgreSQL.
   - Helps define and manage **SQL transformations**.

### 9. **fastapi**
   - Useful for building REST APIs to expose data engineering services.
   - Low-latency and async-friendly for fintech applications.

## Performance Considerations
- **DuckDB in-memory processing** reduces query times significantly.
- **PostgreSQL partitioning** optimizes historical data storage.
- **Azure Functions + Event Hub** enables **real-time detection pipelines**.

## Conclusion
By integrating **DuckDB, PostgreSQL, and Azure**, fintech companies can build high-performance **intraday analytics pipelines** to detect fraud in real-time. Additionally, utilizing powerful libraries like **pandas, duckdb, psycopg2, sqlalchemy, and dbt** enhances data engineering workflows, making them efficient and scalable.
